Our team has published a new paper in Optics Letters: [High-precision acoustic event monitoring in single-mode fibers using Fisher information](https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.570619)

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

# Summary

 - We have shown how to choose the optimal input polarization state for sensing of a single‑mode fiber sensor by maximizing Fisher information.
 - Doing so boosts SNR from $\sim4.3$ dB to $\sim37.6$ dB and flattens the frequency response $1.5-15$ kHz for acoustic sensing.
 - You don’t need exotic hardware. Just measure the Mueller matrix (or more generally the transmission matrix) under a small stimulus, compute a Fisher operator, launch the corresponding “max‑info” polarization (other controlled input state).

# Why you should care

If you run sensors where the readout depends on a configuration knob (polarization, phase bias, laser detuning, etc.), there’s often a “sweet spot” with the highest sensitivity. This paper gives a statistically principled recipe to find that spot using Fisher information, a concept common across estimation theory and metrology. It’s hardware‑agnostic and portable to other sensing problems.

# Physical idea behind our work

 **1** - Light’s state of polarization (SoP) is a 3‑vector on the Poincaré sphere (Stokes vector).

 **2** - The fiber acts like a Mueller matrix $M$ that maps input SoP to output SoP. External perturbations (strain/pressure/acoustics) slightly change $M$.

 **3** - If a small known perturbation $\delta x$ (e.g., a signal on a piezo) is applied to the system, you can estimate how sensitive the output is: essentially $\partial M/\partial x$.

 **4** - With a noise model (Gaussian noise for each Stokes component), you can compute a Fisher information operator $F$. Its largest eigenvector is the input polarization that maximizes information about $\delta x$.

# Experimental work

 - Setup: 1550 nm laser $\rightarrow$ polarization control (HWP+QWP on motorized stages) $\rightarrow$ $3$ m SMF‑28 $\rightarrow$ piezo actuator (acoustic stimulus) $\rightarrow$ high‑speed polarimeter (read Stokes in real time).
 - Characterization: We measured the Mueller matrix with and without a small sinusoidal perturbation ($4$ kHz) $\rightarrow$ finite‑difference to get $\partial M/\partial x$.
 - Optimization: Built the Fisher operator $F$ from the noise‑weighted sensitivity; computed its principal eigenvector (the “max‑info” SoP).
 - Validation: Applied a chirp $1.5-15$ kHz and compared a generic SoP vs. the Fisher‑optimal SoP.
 - Results: SNR improved $\sim9×$ in dB ($\sim4.3 \rightarrow \sim37.6$ dB) and the response became almost flat across $1.5-15$ kHz. We also reconstructed broadband audio with lower RMSE using the optimized state.

# Fisher information

Fisher information  $\mathcal{I}(x)$ is a concept from statistics that measures how much information an observable signal carries about an unknown parameter. In simple terms, it quantifies how sensitive a measurement is to small changes in the system being studied. A higher Fisher information means the parameter can be estimated more precisely, which makes it a powerful tool for improving the performance of sensing and detection systems. Below is a widget illustrating how the measurement’s standard deviation, $\sigma$, changes as we move from a non-optimized state toward a Fisher-optimal state.

# Results

The experiments demonstrated that polarization states selected using Fisher information achieve a nine-fold improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), rising from $4.3$ dB to $37.6$ dB. This corresponds to an almost $40\times$ increase in amplitude-based sensitivity, with a flat response from 1.5 kHz up to 15 kHz.

A key result was the ability to reconstruct complex audio signals with far greater fidelity than when using non-optimized states. To illustrate this improvement, we will display the reconstructed signals obtained under two different input polarization states — one Fisher-optimized and one random — highlighting the contrast in clarity, noise levels, and event separability.

The Fisher-optimized reconstructions showed cleaner waveforms, sharper spectrograms, and reduced background noise, enabling weak or overlapping events to be clearly distinguished. In contrast, non-optimized states produced noisy, distorted reconstructions with lower temporal resolution.

These findings confirm that Fisher information not only sets a theoretical bound but also serves as a practical optimization principle for distributed acoustic sensing. The approach is hardware-agnostic, scalable, and robust across different fiber lengths and conditions, making it readily applicable to real-world monitoring of seismic, environmental, or infrastructure-related acoustic events.
