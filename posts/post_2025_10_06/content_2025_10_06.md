On August 25th, 2025, researchers from INESC TEC and QUANTOS Diana Guimarães, Rafael Cavaco, Diana Capela, and Pedro Jorge, visited CEITEC’s LIBSLab in Brno, Czech Republic, within the framework of the EXCITE Transnational Access Project.

The visit was dedicated to two ongoing initiatives: RoMi – Robust Mineralogy with Multimodal Spectral Imaging and LIBS4REM – LIBS Interlaboratory Test for Rare-Earth Metals. Both projects share a common goal of advancing the use of multimodal spectral imaging and LIBS for the characterization of mineralogical samples critical to energy transition technologies:

* RoMi focuses on lithium mining, aiming to create a multimodal dataset of ten lithium-bearing minerals. By combining high-resolution LIBS with Raman and hyperspectral reflectance data, the project seeks to improve mineral classification systems and support the development of new collaborative architectures with significant industrial impact.
* LIBS4REM addresses the reproducibility of Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy for rare-earth element (REE) analysis. By comparing results obtained at INESC TEC and CEITEC, the project evaluates the consistency of LIBS measurements across different setups and employs machine learning to process and classify spectral data, establishing best practices for REE characterization. 

During the stay, the QUANTOS team analyzed representative lithium and REE samples using the Lightigo LIBS Discovery system and compared the outcomes with previous LIBS/XRF maps produced in Porto. Access to CEITEC’s advanced instrumentation, experimental setups, and extensive calibration sample collection proved invaluable for benchmarking and robust interpretation.

The exchange also fostered fruitful discussions with Dr. Jakub Buday, Dr. Eva Zikmundová, and group leader Dr. Pavel Pořízka, reinforcing collaboration between the two institutions. The professionalism and support of the CEITEC team ensured the visit was both scientifically productive and personally rewarding.
